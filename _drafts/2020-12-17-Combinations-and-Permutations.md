### What's the Difference?

In English we use the word "combination" loosely, without thinking if the order of things is important. In other words:

>"**My fruit salad is a combination of apples, grapes and bananas**" We don't care what order the fruits are in, they could also be "bananas, grapes and apples" or "grapes, apples and bananas", its the same fruit salad.

>"**The combination to the safe is 472**". Now we do care about the order. "724" won't work, nor will "247". It has to be exactly **4-7-2**.

So, in Mathematics we use more precise language:
* When the order doesn't matter, it is a <span style="color:blue">**Combination**</span>.
* When the order does matter it is a <span style="color:blue">**Permutation**</span>.

> To help you to remember, think "Permutation ... Position"
