I am a computational biophysicist and chemist with over four years of postdoctoral experience in molecular modeling, biomolecular simulations, and force-field development. My research explores protein conformational dynamics, protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions, and the refinement of classical force fields for more accurate biomolecular modeling.

I have published 10+ peer-reviewed papers in leading journals, including Molecular Cell, Advanced Science, JACS, eLife, Biophysical Journal, and Nucleic Acids Research, with more than 250 citations. Collaborating closely with experimental groups, I bridge in silico and in vitro/in vivo studies and have contributed to NIH grants exceeding $3 million.

Beyond research, I mentor young scientists in molecular modeling, simulation workflows, and computational data analysis, and I am passionate about combining scientific rigor with creative visualization to communicate complex molecular mechanisms.
