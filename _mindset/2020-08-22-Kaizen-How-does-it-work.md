#### Ask small Questions

<em>One of the most powerful ways to “program” your brain is the kaizen technique of asking small questions.</em>

> “What shapes our lives are the questions we ask, refuse to ask, or never think to ask.” -- Sam Keen

<strong>Your brain loves questions.</strong> A question wakes up your brain and delights it. Your brain loves to take in questions, even ludicrous or odd ones, and turn them over.

<strong>Tiptoe past fear.</strong> Your brain loves questions and won’t reject them ... unless the question is so big it triggers fear. Questions such as “How am I going to get thin (or rich, or married) by the end of the year?” or “What new product will bring in a million more dollars for the company?” are awfully big and frightening.

#### Kazen tips

You want to do something creative: write a story or a song, paint a picture, dream up your perfect career, or come up with a zinger of a solution to an office problem. But you have no idea where to start. Your mind keeps coming up empty.
During times like these, kaizen can help you summon your powers of inspiration. Although you can’t force your brain to cough up creative ideas on demand, you can program it to launch the imaginative process simply by asking yourself a small question. Here are some of the most popular small questions my clients use for creativity. Feel free to come up with your own. Whatever question you use, your challenge is to ask it with a gentle and patient spirit. When you use a harsh or urgent tone with yourself, fear will clog the creative process.

* What’s one thing I wish to contribute to the world with my book, poem, song, or painting?
* Whom could I ask for help or inspiration?
* What is special about my creative process/talents/business team?
* What type of work would excite and fulfill me?

<em>Remember</em>: If you repeat the question over the course of several days or weeks—or for however long it takes—the hippocampus (the part of the brain that stores information) will have no choice but to address it. And in its own way, on its own timetable, the brain will begin giving you answers.

<em>Breakthrough moments</em> are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere.

(Fig.2 <strong>Atomic Habit</strong> - James Clear) We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

Every day is a gift. Who knows what's waiting for you. <em>Try hard, work smart, be kind, and always smile!</em>
