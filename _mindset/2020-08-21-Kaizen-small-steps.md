(excerpt from <strong>One small step can change your life</strong> --- Robert Maurer)

<em>All changes, even positive ones, are scary. Attempts to reach goals through radical or revolutionary means often fail because they heighten fear. But the small steps of kaizen disarm the brain’s fear response, stimulating rational thought and creative play.</em>

Kaizen is captured in a familiar but powerful saying:

“A journey of a thousand miles must begin with the first step.” — Lao Tzu

### The definition of Kaizen

Kaizen is a term that refers to on-going or continuous improvement. The definition of kaizen comes from two Japanese words: ‘kai’ meaning ‘change’ and ‘zen’ meaning ‘good’. The Japanese philosophy was first introduced by Toyota back in the 1980s and has since been adopted by thousands of companies around the globe. This lean transformation encourages an improvement culture that gradually increases quality, efficiency, and profitability.

So, what is kaizen exactly? Well, it is statistical process control that improves quality in every aspect of your business. Employees are empowered to suggest ideas that address common problems so that they don’t reoccur. By tackling issues head-on, they aren’t allowed to persist and grow into bigger challenges. This grassroots approach delivers incremental improvements that add up to big wins.  This lean digital transformation has begun, saving frontline employees precious time and empowering them at the same time.

> “When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don’t look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens—and when it happens, it lasts.”

— John Wooden, one of the most successful coaches in the history of college basketball

### Small steps, giant leaps

Stunning math of small steps from <strong>Atomic Habit</strong> --- James Clear

> 1$\%$ worse every day for 1 year. $0.99^{365} = 0.03$
<br>
> 1$\%$ better every day for one year. $1.01^{365} = 37.78$

If you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.
