<span style="color:green">**Motivation I: Data Compression**</span>

* We may want to reduce the dimension of our features if we have a lot of redundant data.
* To do this, we find two highly correlated features, plot them, and make a new line that seems to describe both features accurately. We place all the new features on this single line.

Doing dimensionality reduction will reduce the total data we have to store in computer memory and will speed up our learning algorithm.
